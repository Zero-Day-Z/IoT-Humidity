# IoT-Humidity
My first IoT project as part of research for my university. I created a humidity sensor on a Raspberry Pi which measures the humidity in a room when run. There is also an additional component that sends an email to the user with the humidity reading. 
Credits to .Hazarky as this was a collaborative effort.

# Prerequisites
1. Raspberry Pi with Pi Sense Humidity Sensor Board
2. Pip3 with the package: SenseHat and datetime installed
3. A gmail modified to be able to use custom apps

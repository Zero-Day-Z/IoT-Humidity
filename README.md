# IoT-Humidity
My first IoT project as part of research for my university. I created a humidity sensor on a Raspberry Pi which measures the humidity in a room when run. There is also an additional component that sends an email to the user with the humidity reading. Credits to .Hazarky as this was a collaborative effort.
